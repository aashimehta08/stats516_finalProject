# stats516_finalProject

The dataset in this project was sourced from Kaggle. The python code in the data.py file processes the CSV file. I randomly sample 1000 records 
from a total of 25000 and plot the histogram to predict the distribution of the data. Visually, the data looks normally distributed but I confirm this 
using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
